# Instructions

Use HTML, CSS, Javascript/Typescript(preferred) to create intuitive frontends.
Use Bootstrap framework for designing the frontend. No other framework is allowed.
Make suitable assumptions if required to design and implement the web frontend.
Assignments done without the use of classes (OOPs) will not be considered.
The UI shown below is just a representation of the data required. It is not the actual UI.
